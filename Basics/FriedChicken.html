                <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Golden, crispy, and irresistibly juicy, fried chicken is a comfort food classic enjoyed around the world. The secret lies in a well-seasoned coating and the perfect fry—hot enough to create a crunchy crust, but gentle enough to keep the meat tender and moist inside. Traditionally, chicken pieces are marinated in buttermilk to enhance flavor and tenderness, then dredged in a spiced flour mixture before being fried to perfection.

                    Whether served with mashed potatoes and gravy, tucked into a sandwich, or enjoyed cold the next day, fried chicken is beloved for its satisfying crunch and rich flavor. From Southern kitchens in the United States to international variations like Korean-style double-fried chicken, this dish is endlessly adaptable and always crowd-pleasing.

                    <li>Fry 12–15 minutes for drumsticks/thighs, 8–10 minutes for wings/breasts, until golden brown and internal temp reaches 75°C (165°F).</li>
