                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Lasagna is the ultimate layered comfort dish, bringing together tender sheets of pasta, rich tomato sauce, creamy cheese, and savory meat in a baked casserole that’s both hearty and satisfying. Its origins trace back to Italy, where it has been celebrated as a family-style meal for generations, often prepared on Sundays or for special gatherings.

                    Each layer builds depth: pasta for structure, sauce for bold flavor, ricotta or béchamel for creaminess, and mozzarella for that irresistible golden, bubbling top. Whether made traditionally with beef and pork, or adapted with vegetables, seafood, or even plant-based proteins, lasagna remains a timeless dish that invites creativity while delivering warmth in every bite.
