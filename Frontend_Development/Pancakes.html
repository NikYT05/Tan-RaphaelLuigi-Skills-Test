                <p>
                    Light, fluffy, and endlessly versatile, pancakes are a breakfast favorite enjoyed around the world. Made from a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and leavening, they cook quickly on a hot griddle to form golden rounds with soft, tender centers.

                    Perfect for stacking high and drizzling with maple syrup, they can also be paired with fresh fruit, chocolate chips, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Whether served as a quick weekday treat or a leisurely weekend brunch, pancakes offer comfort and sweetness in every bite.

                <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>

                <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined (a few lumps are okay—don’t overmix).</li>

                <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on top and edges look set (about 2–3 minutes). Flip and cook the other side until golden brown (about 1–2 minutes).</li>
                <li>Serve warm with butter, syrup, fruits, or toppings of your choice.</li>
